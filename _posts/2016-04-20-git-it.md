Github suggests following commands when creating a new repository.

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<reponame>.git
git push -u origin master
```

You can also add remote repository with a different name, for example `github`
instead of origin (which obviously already exists in your system), like this:

```bash
git remote add github git@github.com:<username>/<reponame>.git
```

Remember though, everywhere in the tutorial you see `origin` you should
replace it with `github`. For example,

```bash
git push origin master
# should now be
git push github master.
```

However, if you want to see what that origin which already exists is, you can
do a git remote -v. If you think this is there by some error, you can remove
it and add the proper one by doing this:

```bash
git remote rm origin
git remote add github git@github.com:<username>/<reponame>.git
```
